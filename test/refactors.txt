refactors.txt Requirement
In my of design, I encountered was figuring out how many classes 
I need to represent the objects that make up the hotel system. 
I was not sure what to track for the hotel system and what not to. 
For instance, I initially came up with multiple classes but then had 
to narrow it down. I ended up having a customer and room class just to 
be able to better track reservations.
and i need to work on my test cases more.
